# Building UI

<!--
The front end is the part of the website a user or customer interacts with. Front-End Developers also use other tools, ranging from content management systems (CMSs) like WordPress and Drupal to libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue. Libraries and frameworks allow you to use a blueprint to create web elements like buttons rather than creating a new one every time. -->

Why react-focused ?
