# Building UI

Building user interfaces is the main responsability of a front end developer.

The front end is the part of the website a user or customer interacts with. Front-End Developers use tools, ranging from content management systems (CMSs) like WordPress and Drupal to libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.

Libraries and frameworks allow you to create reusable web elements like buttons rather than creating a new one every time.

In this section we will be using React. Why? The simple answer is it's the most popular framework with arguably the largest community of developers around the world. For a more detailed explanation, I encourage you to read this interesting [article](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/react-pros-and-cons/).
